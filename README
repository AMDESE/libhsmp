Host System Management Port library (libhsmp)
=============================================

The Host System Management Port (HSMP) library provides user level
access to the HSMP mailboxes implemented by the firmware in the
System Management Unit (SMU). Full documentation of the HSMP can
be found in the Processor Programming Reference (PPR) for Family
19h on AMD's Developer Central;

https://developer.amd.com/resources/epyc-resources/epyc-specifications

1. Disclaimer
=============

The libhsmp library is supported only on AMD Family 19h (including
third-generation AMD EPYC processors (codenamed "Milan")) or later
CPUs. Using the libhsmp library on earlier CPUs could produce
unexpected results, and may cause the processor to operate outside
of your motherboard or system specifications. Correspondingly, libhsmp
defaults to only executing on AMD Family 19h and later CPUs.

2. Interfaces
=============

A full listing of the interfaces to libhsmp with explanations is
available in libhsmp.h.

2.1. Environment Variables
==========================

2.1.1. LIBHSMP_WAIT_TIME
The environment variable LIBHSMP_WAIT_TIME sets the time libhsmp waits
before polling the answer on a request in nanoseconds. By default
libhsmp waits 1,000,000 ns (i.e., 1 ms). You can lower the time by
setting this variable to something between 0 (busy-waiting) and
1000000 as a waiting time in nanoseconds.

2.1.2. LIBHSMP_FAM17_WARNING
The environment variable LIBHSMP_FAM17_WARNING allows you to disable
the Family 17h warning, which could trigger some errors if stderr is
parsed by a error checking tool. By setting LIBHSMP_FAM17_WARNING to
"0", "n", "N", or "No" you can disable the warning message
" WARNING: libhsmp not supported ...".

3. Errors
=========

The interfaces exported by libhsmp can return two types of errors,
a standard Linux errno error or a HSMP defined error. To support
this the library interfaces are designed to return 0 on success
and a non-zero value on failure. A return value >0 indicates a
HSMP defined error and a return value of -1 indicates a Linux error
where errno will be set.

To ease the determination of errors, a hsmp_strerror() interface is
provided that will return a proper error string for HSMP defined
errors and the standard Linux error string for all other return values
from libhsmp.

The following errno values are set by libhsmp.

o EPERM     - set for any non-privileged caller of libhsmp.

o ENOTSUP   - set if HSMP is disabled in BIOS or the CPU model/family
              is not supported.

o ENODEV    - set when PCI bus enumeration in libhsmp initialization fails.

o ENOMSG    - set when the provided HSMP message id is not supported by
              the HSMP interface version.

o EBADMSG   - set when the provided HSMP message id is supported by the
              HSMP interface version but not by the SMU firmware version.

o EAGAIN    - set when a failure occurs during libhsmp initialization where
              a future call to libhsmp may succeed.

o EINVAL    - set for any invalid parameter passed to libhsmp.

o ETIMEDOUT - set when communication with the HSMP mailboxes timnes out.


4. Build
========

To build and install the libhsmp library use the following commands.

#> ./autogen.sh
#> ./configure
#> make
#> make install

5. Testing
==========

The libhsmp source contains a test module that attempts to invoke
each API exported by libhsmp with both valid and invalid parameters.
The commands needed to drive the test suite are built by default when
building the libhsmp library. The run_tests.sh script can be used
to run the test suite and validate libhsmp.
