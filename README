Host System Management Port library (libhsmp)
=============================================

The Host System Management Port (HSMP) library provides user level
access to the HSMP mailboxes implemented by the firmware in the
System Management Unit (SMU). Full documentation of the HSMP can
be found in the Processor Programming Reference (PPR) for Family
19h on AMD's Developer Central;

https://developer.amd.com/resources/epyc-resources/epyc-specifications

1. Disclaimer
=============

The libhsmp library is supported only on AMD Family 19h (including
third-generation AMD EPYC processors (codenamed "Milan")) or later
CPUs. Using the libhsmp library on earlier CPUs could produce
unexpected results, and may cause the processor to operate outside
of your motherboard or system specifications. Correspondingly, libhsmp
defaults to only executing on AMD Family 19h and later CPUs.

2. Interfaces
=============

A full listing of the interfaces to libhsmp with explanations is
available in libhsmp.h.

3. Errors
=========

The interfaces exported by libhsmp can return two types of errors,
a standard Linux errno error or a HSMP defined error. To support
this the library interfaces are designed to return 0 on success
and a non-zero value on failure. A return value >0 indicates a
HSMP defined error and a return value of -1 indicates a Linux error
where errno will be set.

To ease the determination of errors, a hsmp_strerror() interface is
provided that will return a proper error string for all return values
from libhsmp.

4. Build
========

To build and install the libhsmp library use the following commands.

#> ./autogen.sh
#> ./configure
#> make
#> make install

5. Testing
==========

The libhsmp source contains a test module that attempts to invoke
each API exported by libhsmp with both valid and invalid parameters.
The commands needed to drive the test suite are built by default when
building the libhsmp library. The run_tests.sh script can be used
to run the test suite and validate libhsmp.
