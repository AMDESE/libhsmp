    examples: Add hsmpctl commnd
    
    The hsmpctl command provides a command line interface to the
    HSMP mailboxes exposed in libhsmp. The hsmpctl commad works by
    communicating with libhsmp through the hsmpctld daemon. This
    allows for some abstraction on the commands in hsmpctl and
    allows for non-privileged users to view read-only attributes
    from libhsmp.

    examples: Initial commit of NBIO example app
    
    This simple example application uses the HSMP message to set PCI-e root
    complex logic (NBIO) to the highest power state. The use case for this
    is for servers with multiple GPUs or Infiniband NICs, where the latency
    and/or bandwidth for small messages is critical.

    libhsmp: Improve error handling in hsmp_next_bus
    
    Initial commit of this API made it difficult to distinguish errors vs.
    reaching the end of iterations. This commit improves error handling here
    by:
    
    * Returning any error code returned from library initialization (though
      currently only -1 is returned so no actual change, but better code)
    
    * Setting errno = EINVAL if invalid parameters are passed when calling
      (consistent with other library API error handling)
    
    * Setting errno = ENODEV if a valid value is passed for idx but there
      is no IOHC entry at that index (e.g. 1P system and idx=4 is passed)
    
    * Returning 0 when returning the last bus in the system
    
    Thus, proper use is:
    
        do {
            idx = hsmp_next_bus(idx, &bus_num);
            if (idx < 0) break and evaluate errno
            do useful work, break out if error
        } while (idx > 0);
        Evaluate potential errors if idx != 0
    
    Since any working platform must have at least four IOHC devices, there
    should never be a case where the platform and HSMP is working but the
    first call to this API fails with ENODEV, provided the iteration starts
    with idx = 0.

    Update errno return values
    
    To clarify the different failures in libhsmp this updates the
    errno values the libhsmp library sets and ensures they are
    consistently applied.
    
    EPERM - set for any non-root caller to libhsmp.
    
    ENOTSUP - set if HSMP is disabled in BIOS or the CPU mopdel/family
    is not supported.
    
    ENODEV - set when initialization of PCI bus enumeration in
    libhsmp fails.
    
    ENOMSG - set if the HSMP message id is not supported by the current
    hsmp interface version.
    
    EBADMSG - set if the HSMP message id is supported by the current
    HSMP interface version but not supported by the SMU fw.
    
    EAGAIN - set if a failure occurs during libhsmp initialization
    where a future call to libhsmp may succeed.
    
    EINVAL - set for any invalid parameter passed to libhsmp.
    
    ETIMEDOUT - set when a call to the HSMP mailboxes times out

    Reorder DF P-state enum for code clarity
    
    Starting enum hsmp_df_pstate with the value for auto means that the
    values 1-4 result for P-states 0-3. The code has to subtract one before
    passing this value to the hardware.
    
    By moving the auto value to the end of the enum, the enum values are
    aligned with the hardware values making the code a bit cleaner.

    Recognize when HSMP is not enabled
    
    BIOS on systems provides a method to disable the HSMP mailboxes.
    Doing this will result in HAMP requests to time out. As of now
    this is the only indicator we have that HSMP is disabled.
    
    Update libhsmp to recognize when a timeout occurs for a HSMP call
    and set a flag to indicate that HSMP is disabled. This allows
    the library to short circuit any future calls so it does go
    through the set up process and simply returns ENOTSUP.
    
    Additionally, to properly handle this major updates had to be
    made to the hsmp_test test program.

    The enum for fabric P-state is 0-4 in the header file, with value 0

    Set NBIO P-state fn should use bus number
    
    The hsmp_set_nbio_pstate function should use the PCI bus number instead
    of socket ID since there are four NBIO tiles per socket. Since the
    end-user or software "sees" the PCI system as bus numbers, not as NBIO
    tiles or root complex IDs, take the bus number and translate it to the
    corresponding socket ID and NBIO tile ID to send the appropriate HSMP
    message.
    
    Update hsmp_test.c based on this change by removing the test for an
    invalid bus number. Now that the bus number is specified as an u8
    we don't have a invalid value that works. This should be re-added
    if we can find a way to specify an invalid bus number.

    Fix use of socket ID vs. NBIO index
    
    The intent of the nbios array stored in hsmp_data is to hold the NBIO ID
    (unique to each socket) and the PCI bus base and limit values for each
    NBIO tile to assist with translating a PCI bus to the socket and NBIO
    tile ID hosting that bus. The PCI device for each NBIO is kept here as
    well as a matter of convenience. All HSMP messages must be sent to an
    IOHC device in the specific socket (0 or 1) for which the message is
    intended. After sorting the NBIOs array based on the bus base/limit,
    index 0 into that array will correspond with the lowest bus in socket 0,
    and if present, index 4 into that array will correspond with the lowest
    bus in socket 1. While technically using any IOHC device in a socket
    will work to communicate with the HSMP mailbox, the first (lowest bus
    number) IOHC device is used as a matter of convention. Therefore, when
    accessing the correct PCI device, socket ID must be multiplied by 4 to
    get to the NBIO array index.
    
    In a 1P system, NBIO array indexes 4-7 will be empty, so test for a
    NULL pointer for the PCI device.
