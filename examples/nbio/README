AMD I/O Power Management Utility
================================
Version 1.3  April 9, 2021
Author: Lewis Carroll <lewis.carroll@amd.com>


Usage: amd-iopm-util [option]

This utility leverages libhsmp to support disabling Dynamic Power Management
(DPM) for all PCI-e root complexes in the system and locks the logic into the
highest performance operational mode. A typical use case for this utility is
a host with multiple GPUs or Infiniband NICs where the latency / bandwidth for
small message sizes is critical to overall system performance.


Options:
-v  --version     Display program version and exit
-h  --help        Display program usage and exit


Run Requirements
================
* Must be run as root


Building
========
Dependencies: libhsmp (follow build instructions in the README for libhsmp)
  Note: libhsmp requires autoconf, libtool and the PCI development library
        libpci-dev (Ubuntu) or pciutils-devel (Red Hat / CentOS)

Depending on your system, you may need to update the dynamic linker cache
after installing libhsmp. You should be able to do this with sudo ldconfig.

If you wish to generate debug output from HSMP messages you should configure
libhsmp for debug output (configure libhsmp with --enable-debug).

If you wish to also enable family 17h (Rome), you should configure libhsmp
with --enable-fam17.

The default makefile target is the executable, and a clean target is supported.
